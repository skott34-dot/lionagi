# Lion Studio

Web interface for Lion. The default experience is zero-install: the hosted
client-side SPA at <https://lion-studio.khive.ai> connects to your local
daemon at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Studio state remains in that local daemon;
model requests follow the data-handling terms of the provider you use. The
same-origin FastAPI-served build remains available for Docker, source, and dev
modes.

## Project Layout

```text
apps/studio/
└── frontend/               Vite + React SPA
    ├── src/                Source (routes, components, lib)
    ├── dist/               Built output (served by FastAPI)
    └── vite.config.mts     Dev server proxies /api → localhost:8765
```

The backend lives at `lionagi/studio/` (installed as part of the `lionagi[studio]`
package). Studio routers are mounted under `/api`, and the built `dist/` is
mounted as a static SPA fallback on all other paths.

## Environment Variables

All variables are optional; defaults are shown.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | FastAPI bind host |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_PORT` | `8765` | FastAPI bind port |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | *(unset)* | Bearer token for `/api/*` routes |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_FRONTEND_DIST` | `apps/studio/frontend/dist` | Path to built SPA dist/ |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_OPERATOR_CWD` | user home (`/workspace` in Docker) | Absolute execution root for Operator CLI providers |
| `LIONAGI_HOME` | `~/.lionagi` | Base LionAGI data directory (holds `state.db`) |
| `LIONAGI_SHOWS_ROOT` | `~/khive-work/shows` | Show artifact root |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_MIRROR_CLAUDE` | `1` | Enable Studio's in-process transcript mirror |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_MIRROR_SOURCE` | `both` | Transcript providers to mirror: `both`, `claude`, or `codex` |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_MIRROR_CLAUDE_ROOT` | *(unset)* | Explicit Claude projects source root |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_MIRROR_CODEX_ROOT` | *(unset)* | Explicit Codex sessions source root |
| `LIONAGI_STUDIO_MIRROR_IMPORT_AMBIENT` | automatic | Read `~/.claude`/`~/.codex`; on by default only for the conventional `~/.lionagi` profile |
| `STUDIO_API_URL` | selected `--host` / `--port` in dev mode | Explicit Vite proxy target; an operator-supplied value takes precedence over CLI flags |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `localhost:5173,localhost:3000` | Comma-separated allowed browser origins |

Selecting a different `LIONAGI_HOME` creates an isolated Studio profile: its
mirror does not read the ambient user transcript trees unless explicit roots
are configured or `LIONAGI_STUDIO_MIRROR_IMPORT_AMBIENT=1` opts back in.

The three mirror settings above refuse a value they do not recognize, and
Studio fails to start rather than guessing. The boolean flags take `1`, `true`,
`yes`, `on` and `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` (empty means off);
`LIONAGI_STUDIO_MIRROR_SOURCE` takes exactly `both`, `claude`, or `codex`.
These settings decide whether Studio reads your own transcript trees, so
`MIRROR_IMPORT_AMBIENT=disabled` stopping the daemon is the intended outcome:
previously it was read as "on", which is the opposite of what it says.

## Running

**Default (hosted UI + local daemon)**:

```bash
li studio          # starts the local daemon and opens https://lion-studio.khive.ai;
                   # nothing is built locally (pass --no-open to skip the browser)
```

**Self-contained local build (Docker or same-origin serve)**:

```bash
li studio --docker # auto-pulls ghcr.io/ohdearquant/lion-studio; UI + API on :8765
```

**Dev mode (hot-reload)**:

```bash
li studio --dev              # Vite on :3000 + uvicorn on :8765
li studio --dev --port 45241 # Vite proxies /api, /health, and /openapi.json to :45241
```

**Backend only** (e.g. desktop shell):

```bash
li studio --no-frontend
```

## Operator quickstart

Operator uses the locally installed Claude Code CLI and its own authenticated
session by default. The Studio extra does not install or sign in to Claude
Code.

The daemon freezes its Operator execution-root configuration at startup and
logs both the resolved root and the rule that selected it. An explicit
`LIONAGI_STUDIO_OPERATOR_CWD` wins; otherwise the shipped daemon-config default
is the user's home directory. A project-bearing conversation uses that
project's registered path when no environment override is set, while a normal
browser-created conversation uses the frozen daemon default. An invalid
explicit setting or selected project fails closed instead of falling through
to another root or inheriting whichever directory launched the daemon.

The Studio image explicitly sets the root to `/workspace`, not its application
`WORKDIR /app`, and declares `/workspace` as a volume. Bind-mount the code the
Operator should work on there, for example `-v "$PWD:/workspace"` when running
the image directly.

On a fresh machine:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install "lionagi[studio]"

npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude --version
claude auth login

li studio
```

See [Claude Code setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) for other
supported installation and authentication methods.

In Studio, use the speech-bubble button at the top of the left rail, press
<kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>, or choose **Toggle Operator** from
the command palette. The dock can close while a turn runs; closing it does not
stop the turn.

- Conversation history is stored by the daemon. Reloading the page or reopening
  the dock restores the selected conversation and its earlier activity.
- **Stop** requests cancellation of the active turn. It does not undo tool work
  that already completed.
- Disk writes, commands, and other gated work pause on a **Permission required**
  card. **Allow** permits that request; **Deny** blocks it. The engine waits for
  the decision.
- Every Operator turn has an **Open run** link into Fleet's Runs view. Run
  detail also offers **Continue this run** for live or terminal runs that still
  have a persisted branch. A follow-up submitted while the current leg is
  still live is queued and starts after that leg reaches a terminal state.
- The run detail CLI escape hatch is equivalent to:

  ```bash
  li agent -r '<branch-id>' --prompt '<follow-up instruction>'
  ```

For permission behavior, resume details, real-provider verification, and the
CI stub boundary, see the [Studio guide](../../docs/guides/studio.md).

## Development

**Backend** (auto-reloads):

```bash
uv run uvicorn lionagi.studio.app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

**Frontend** (separate terminal):

```bash
cd apps/studio/frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173 — proxies /api → :8765
```

## Authentication

When `LIONAGI_STUDIO_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset, all local API routes are open.

When set, all `/api/*` requests must include:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

`/health` remains open regardless.

## Database

Studio uses the LionAGI state database at `$LIONAGI_HOME/state.db`
(default `~/.lionagi/state.db`).

## Testing

```bash
# Full suite
uv run pytest tests/apps_studio_server/ -x

# Skip slow integration tests
uv run pytest tests/apps_studio_server/ -m "not (integration or network)" -x

# Strict warnings (CI gate)
uv run pytest tests/apps_studio_server/ -W error
```

## Desktop App (macOS)

See [`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md) for the full guide.

**Quick start:**

```bash
# 1. Build the SPA (required before running the shell)
cd apps/studio/frontend && npm install && npm run build

# 2. Run the shell
cd ../desktop/src-tauri && cargo run

# 3. Dev mode (Vite hot-reload + Tauri)
#    Terminal 1: cd apps/studio/frontend && npm run dev
#    Terminal 2: cd apps/studio/desktop/src-tauri && cargo tauri dev

# 4. Build .app bundle
cargo tauri build         # signed + DMG
cargo build --release     # binary only, no signing
```

The shell finds the `li` CLI automatically (searches PATH,
`~/.local/bin/li`, `~/.cargo/bin/li`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/li`), spawns
`li studio --no-frontend --port <free-port>`, and loads the SPA with
`window.__STUDIO_API_BASE__` pre-set via Tauri's initialization script API.
