/**
 * These tests start where the app starts — raw signal events as they arrive off
 * the wire — and end at the text a node card actually renders, running the
 * production path in between: the wire normalizer, the correlation, the canvas
 * projection, and the real StepNode.
 *
 * That span is the point. The activity fold was fully unit-tested and green
 * while nothing in the app called it and no card carried live data, so an
 * assertion that stops at the fold cannot tell a wired projection from an
 * unwired one. Both failure modes this covers are silent in exactly that way:
 * an unwired projection renders the plain status word, and a timestamp left in
 * the backend's seconds renders every signalled node as "stalled" — neither
 * throws, and both look like a run that simply has nothing to report.
