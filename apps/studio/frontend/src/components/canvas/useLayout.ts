// one constant describes it at every moment of a run, and dagre reserves
// exactly what the node occupies.
//
// It used to grow a row at a time as a run filled its data in, which meant the
// height depended on how far along the run was, ranks came out ragged, and this
// function had to guess. Fixing the card removed the guess: two nodes side by
// side are the same size whether or not either has finished.
//
// The height below is ADDED UP from the rows the card draws rather than kept as
// a literal, because a literal can only ever be checked against itself: a test
// asserting the card's style height equals the constant passes whatever the
// constant says, including when the content needs more room than it grants.
// Carried as a literal it was 88 while the card drew 98 worth of rows, so a
// running node — the widest border — overflowed its own border.
//
// The card also reserved two lines for the agent's latest text, and nothing on
// the wire fills them. The one signal that carries assistant content is reduced
// to a bare reference before it is stored, and that reference has no operation
// id or step name to correlate it to a node, so every card drew an empty block.
// The reservation is gone until a signal exists that can fill it. Removing it
// also buys back the vertical space a wide graph needs to stay readable.
//
// The sum still runs one pixel over what a browser measures, because the name
// row is reserved from its type scale (ceil of 12px at 1.375 leading = 17)
// where the browser lays it out at 16. Leave it: over-reserving costs a pixel
// of empty card, under-reserving clips text, and the drawn height depends on
// font metrics that are not the same on every platform.

// The type scale these rows are set in (theme.css --t-xs / --t-sm) and the two
