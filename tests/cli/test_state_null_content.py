"""Reclaiming a message body has to stay distinguishable from never having one.

The prune selects sessions, but the bytes live on messages, and a message any
surviving progression still names is kept whatever its age — so a store can
be almost entirely message content, with every message inside the
keep-window, and give a prune nothing to delete. This command selects on the
axis the bytes are actually on.

An emptied body is otherwise indistinguishable from a turn that genuinely
produced nothing, and nothing downstream has a second source for that
distinction, so the two would collapse into one state permanently. A
reclaimed body therefore carries a marker, and the tests that matter most
here assert the difference is visible at the consumer, not just the writer —
the writer knowing what it wrote is not the property anyone depends on.

No LLM and no network: these run against a temp SQLite file.
