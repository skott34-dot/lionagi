"""Short ids are guesses, and every CLI resolver has to treat them as one.

A full id is a primary key and settles the question. A prefix does not: it can
fit several records, and there is no rule that makes one of them the right
answer. Each of these resolvers feeds a command that acts — resuming a branch,
killing a process, replaying a run — so picking a match is picking a target the
caller never named. These tests hold all four to refusing instead.
