"""Agent-leg steer: enqueue gate, turn-end drain, terminal tombstone, status.

A `message` control queued against a running agent session lands as a warm
continuation turn when the in-flight operate() returns. pause/resume have no
seam inside a single turn and are refused at enqueue. A steer no consumer ever
claimed is finalized rejected at teardown, and the status surface renders it as
never-landed regardless. A steer a consumer did claim is a different state and
stays standing: it names its owner and the time the claim was taken, because
nothing after the fact can say whether that consumer delivered the message.
