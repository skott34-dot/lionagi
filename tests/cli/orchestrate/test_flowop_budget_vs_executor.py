"""Does the budget's divisor cover every schedule the executor can produce?

`op_budget_share` divides a flow's total budget by `max_sequential_depth`; a
divisor landing BELOW what the executor actually consumes hands every op more
time than the flow can afford, overrunning the deadline with later ops
cancelled part-written. Every other test of that function checks its
arithmetic against a hand-computed number, which cannot see whether the
executor agrees -- these run the executor, through the real `flow()` entry
point production uses. Only the work inside an op belongs to the test.

An earlier version slept a FIXED amount in every op, which held the
equal-duration assumption the divisor was built on and so agreed with a
divisor that undercounted, reading as coverage while doing it. Durations here
are deliberately unequal, and each shape is swept with the long op in every
admission position, since a long-running op holding a slot is what makes the
ops behind it serialize.

Every op sleeps exactly one budget unit in the primary pattern, so elapsed
wall clock divided by that unit is literally the number of op-budgets
consumed -- the quantity the divisor bounds: the flow overruns precisely when
consumption exceeds the divisor.

This replaces an earlier reading that took the longest chain of
non-overlapping spans, which is wrong in both directions. It OVER-counts:
two ops separated by an idle gap are non-overlapping while consuming no
budget in between, so a chain across a gap some third op owns reads as extra
free stages (measured: deps [[], [0], [0], [1], [2]] under a cap of 3 with
one slow op reads a chain of 4, while the same shape at full budget consumes
3). It UNDER-counts: two ops overlapping by half consume one and a half
budgets at a chain length of 1. Because the span reading over-counts, it
would have failed this suite on shapes that do not overrun -- a false alarm
in a test whose whole job is to be believed.

A straight chain consumes exactly one budget per op by construction, so it
also measures this machine's per-op executor overhead in the same units
everything else is reported in. The work unit has to stay well above that
overhead: at 0.15s the ~5ms per-op cost perturbs which ops get admitted
together, so the instrument changes the schedule it is measuring and
readings move by a whole budget between runs. At the unit below, readings
sit within 0.06 of an integer.
