"""Tests for the schedule and schedule-run response surfaces.

Covers pagination and status filtering on the run list, and the projection every
list surface applies: run lists serve a classification of a failure rather than the
text that produced it, and schedule records are served through an allow-list. The
raw traceback stays reachable through the single-run detail route.
