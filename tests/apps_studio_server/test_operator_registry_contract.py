"""Registry contract for the Studio Operator MCP tool surface.

Covers two things that the individual handler test files do not:
one, that `_TOOL_HANDLERS` still contains every tool it held before this
change plus every tool this change adds; two, that each newly added
handler never reaches a write-shaped method on the store it is given,
proving the "read-only" contract by exercising the handler rather than
by reading its source.
