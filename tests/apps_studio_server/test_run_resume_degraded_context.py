"""End-to-end degraded-context refusal, through the real detached-launch pipeline.

test_run_resume_dispatch.py's degraded-context coverage stubs
``launch_detached_argv`` itself, so it only proves the flag is appended (or
withheld) in the built argv -- it never exercises what happens to a
refusal once a detached process actually runs and fails. This module
keeps ``_launches.launch_detached_argv`` and ``_spawn_detached`` real
(only the OS-level subprocess spawn, ``spawn_and_wait``, is stubbed, the
same boundary test_launches_api.py stubs at), so a checkpoint with
multiple pending inherited-context operations drives the full path:
dispatch -> detached launch -> subprocess failure ->
``_failure_reason_summary`` -> persisted invocation row -> the summary a
client would read.
