"""The third state a data route needs when the configured store has no file.

``require_file_store`` distinguishes three conditions from ``state_db_file()``
alone: a store path that exists (answer the rows), one that does not exist yet
(answer empty, unchanged), and no path at all -- a server-backed or in-memory
store this SQLite-direct layer cannot open. Only the third one raises.

The suite below pins all three, plus the one thing a must-refuse-only suite
would miss: a route in front of an *existing* store must still answer with its
real rows, not get swept into the refusal by an over-eager guard.
