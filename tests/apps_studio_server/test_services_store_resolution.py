"""The studio services open the store the daemon serves.

Every service in this layer used to name ``DEFAULT_DB_PATH`` at import.
That is the right file until ``LIONAGI_STATE_DB_URL`` moves the store, and
then it is a different database from the one the daemon writes: the routes
report on rows nobody is serving, and SQLite creates the unrelated file on
connect if it is not already there.

Two things are pinned: a deployment that has not moved anything sees no
change, and a health answer and a data answer come from the same store
(two services resolving separately was the original defect).

The default path is present and wrong in these tests, not absent, so a
service still reading it answers from an empty database instead of
raising -- that silent-wrong-answer failure is what must stay visible.
