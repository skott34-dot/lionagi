"""Tests for the schedule_runs staleness reaper.

A schedule_run row has no process-liveness signal to check against (the
"process" is the scheduler daemon itself, and its own restart is what
triggers reaping), so this reaper is a pure wall-clock deadline against the
row's own updated_at/fired_at, guarded by the same optimistic-lock
(expected_updated_at) pattern reap_stale_plays uses.
