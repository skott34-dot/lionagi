        Several of them close an event loop while a database connection's

        end of its self-pipe before the write end, so a thread handing back
        a result in that window writes to a pipe whose peer is gone. Under
        the interpreter default that's an ``OSError`` asyncio swallows.
        Under ``SIG_DFL`` the kernel kills the process first, with buffered
        output still buffered: no traceback, no failing assertion, just a
        worker that stopped.

        The CLI sets ``SIG_DFL`` on entry deliberately, so a command in a
        pipeline dies quietly when its reader leaves. ``signal.signal`` is
        process-wide, so any test that drives the CLI in-process leaks that
        policy to every test after it; a fixture in ``tests/conftest.py``
        restores it, and this asserts the restore actually happened.

        Order-dependent by nature -- it only catches the leak when something
        that changed the policy ran earlier in this same process (run this
        file after ``tests/cli`` with ``-n 0`` to see it fail without the
        fixture). Distributed across workers it may pass without proving
        anything, so it is written to never fail falsely.
