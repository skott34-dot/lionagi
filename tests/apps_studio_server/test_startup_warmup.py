"""The startup WAL checkpoint is deferred off the readiness path; reconciliation
is not.

The studio lifespan keeps stale-session reconciliation pre-yield (stateful
/api routes read the rows it corrects) but defers the WAL checkpoint to a
background task so /health serves as soon as reconciliation completes,
without waiting on the checkpoint. These tests pin that contract: the
deferred checkpoint still runs with actor='startup', a shutdown landing
mid-checkpoint cancels it cleanly, and a checkpoint failure is logged
rather than silently dropped.

The real scheduler is patched out: its first tick runs the same
maintenance functions (and spawns aiosqlite workers), which would
otherwise pollute these assertions and leave a worker posting to a closed
loop at teardown.
