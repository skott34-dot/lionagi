"""Every command the CLI offers is either registered or named absent.

The privilege fence already guards the other direction: a verb cannot become
reachable without someone writing its path into a reviewed list. Nothing
guarded this one -- a command could be added to the CLI and the catalog
would simply not mention it, and silence reads the same as
considered-and-declined, which is the one thing the absent entries exist to
distinguish. Twenty-three commands had accumulated that way before this
test existed.

The CLI surface is measured here rather than listed, since a list of
command paths in a test is a second copy of the parser tree that would go
stale the same way the catalog did.
