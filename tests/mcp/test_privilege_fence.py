"""Operations that grant privilege stay off this surface.

Every caller here is an agent. Trusting a plugin lets a bundle run code in
the process, trusting a hook does the same for a hook bundle, and migrating
the store rewrites what the rest of these verbs report on -- exposing any of
them would let the thing being granted a right be the thing that grants it,
so these stay human-at-a-terminal operations.

The fence is an allowlist, so the interesting assertions are about the
routes around it rather than the three names: a verb that is not
registered, a command path that is not a verb's path, and the absence of
any parameter that carries opaque argv.
