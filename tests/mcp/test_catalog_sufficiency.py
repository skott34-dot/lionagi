"""The catalog has to be enough to write the call it describes.

``help=true`` promises its answer is enough to make the common call. That
promise only holds if the entry carries everything the call is gated on, so
these tests build ops from the catalog reply alone and check that nothing
refuses them on a gate the catalog was supposed to have satisfied.

The spawn verbs are the gated ones, and running one starts a background
agent, so the ops here are steered into a refusal that lies *past* every
gate (an unreadable prompt file): a call rejected for its prompt is a call
whose fingerprint was accepted, which is the fact under test -- nothing is
actually spawned to establish it.
