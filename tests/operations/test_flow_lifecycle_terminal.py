"""Lifecycle telemetry corrections: one stable identity across queued/started/

"started" across success, failure, cancellation, and abandonment.

Regression guards for the root cause traced in signal_root_cause.md: a node
built without ``reference_id`` was announced under the UUID prefix at queued
time and under the branch name at started time, and a cancelled or otherwise
abandoned operation never reached a terminal on_progress call at all — the
