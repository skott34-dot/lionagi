# The guard reads the current turn's render by index, which is only the current
# turn's render because every assembly branch appends the current turn last. The
# tests above cannot see a violation of that premise: they patch renders and
# observe the guard, and both the by-index read and a bare after-the-loop read
# agree as long as the premise holds. So a future edit that appends anything
# after the current turn would leave those tests green while the guard silently
# started inspecting the wrong entry — and in the direction that matters, a
# genuinely dropped instruction going unnoticed.

# These pin the premise itself, one per assembly branch, through the public
# return: with every entry rendering normally, the last outgoing message is the
# current turn's.
