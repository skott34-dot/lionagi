"""Readers must decide "there is nothing recorded" against the configured
store, not against the default path.

``LIONAGI_STATE_DB_URL`` moves the state store — to another SQLite file, to a
server, or into memory. A guard that asks whether ``DEFAULT_DB_PATH`` exists
answers about a file that need not be involved, and every row in the store that
*is* involved is reported missing.

Both shapes are covered here: a SQLite store moved to a non-default path, and a
URL that is not a local file at all.
