"""A pre-rebuild backup must refuse rather than copy a partially checkpointed store.

`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` asks for a full checkpoint and reports whether
it got one. Where it does not, committed transactions are still in the `-wal`
sidecar, and the main database file on its own is a rollback artifact predating
them. Copying anyway produces a backup that restores cleanly while silently
missing data, on the one path whose entire purpose is being able to go back.
