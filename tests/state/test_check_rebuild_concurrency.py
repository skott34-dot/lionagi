"""Concurrency-safety tests for the legacy CHECK-constraint table-rebuild
migrations in ``lionagi/state/db.py`` (``_drop_legacy_*_check``).

These migrations rebuild a table (DROP/CREATE/INSERT/RENAME) when they find
a stale CHECK constraint. Two processes cold-opening the same legacy DB can
both observe the stale CHECK and enter the same rebuild; SQLite's write lock
serializes the two attempts, but the loser can still surface an
OperationalError instead of quietly recognizing that the winner already
finished the identical rebuild. Mirrors the multi-process harness in
``test_migrations.py`` (``test_concurrent_statedb_opens_reconcile_cc_session_column``).
