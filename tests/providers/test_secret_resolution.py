"""``secrets.lookup`` fills a declared variable into a CLI child's environment.

A CLI provider reads its credential from its own environment. When the value
lives in a keychain instead, the spawning process has nothing to pass and the
child dies on a missing variable. These cover the two halves: what counts as a
configured lookup, and what the child actually receives.

The failure mode worth guarding is quiet. A lookup that resolves nothing and a
machine that configured none both end with the child's environment untouched,
so the resolution keeps them apart explicitly rather than reporting one number
for both.
