"""What every CLI adapter must show a stream consumer when a session fails.

Full design rationale, the per-adapter comparison, and what this suite does
not cover: see docs/internals/providers.md#cli-adapter-error-chunk-conformance.

The contract, per adapter, in three separate assertions:

1. a session finishing with ``is_error`` set yields EXACTLY ONE chunk of type
   ``error``,
2. that chunk carries ``is_error``, and
3. a session finishing WITHOUT ``is_error`` yields ZERO chunks of type
   ``error``.

Each test patches ``<module>._ndjson_from_cli``, the module-private wrapper
around the shared NDJSON reader, so the fixture is fed to the real parser and
the real ``stream()`` decides what to yield -- nothing here hand-builds a
session and hands it to an endpoint. The CLI-binary guard lives above that
seam, so each test also points the binary constant at a stub path to keep
the real events function in the loop.

This suite lands with the remaining known divergence (pi) marked
``xfail(strict=True)``. An expected failure is unmarked by the divergence it
names being fixed, never by a passing run: a passing xfail here means either
the divergence was fixed without updating this test, or the test stopped
testing what it names.

    three conditions, the raw payload captured before null-normalisation
    specifically so an explicit ``null`` cannot be mistaken for the bare ``{}``
    sentinel. Having decided it is benign it retracts ``session.is_error`` and
    tags the metadata, then yields an error-type chunk anyway.

    That reads like a violation of the third assertion, and the first version of
    this file asserted the chunk away. It should not be asserted away: the tag
    is the contract, pinned by the parser's own tests, and a consumer reading
    either discriminator gets the right answer. What this test pins is that both
