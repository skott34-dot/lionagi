"""A nonzero exit with nothing to quote has more than one cause, and the
message a caller stores has to say which.

`ndjson_from_cli` raises with the child's stderr when there is any, and with a
constructed reason when there is not. Before this, every reason was the same
sentence — the exit code — so a child that failed silently, a child whose
stderr was never opened, and a drain that raised while reading all arrived as
one fact. That direction hides the instrument: a broken capture reads exactly
like a quiet subprocess, and a reader who takes it at face value goes looking
at the child.
