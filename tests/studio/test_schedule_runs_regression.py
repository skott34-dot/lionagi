"""Regression tests for two schedule-runs API defects:

- the ``/schedules/{id}/runs`` route's server-side default page size must
  stay 50 (a prior change silently cut it to 20) while still honoring an
  explicit ``limit=``.
- ``get_schedule_run`` must derive its merged response (legacy fields +
  RunView-reconciled fields) from a single read of the ``schedule_runs``
  row, not two independent reads that can straddle a concurrent write.
