"""Unit tests for patching a schedule's github_cursor.

The cursor is the merged-PR poller's bookmark. Until it was patchable there was
no supported way to move it at all -- not the CLI, not the API, not the
declarative apply path -- so an operator facing a schedule whose backlog would
dispatch all at once had no mechanism short of writing to the store by hand.
