"""The scheduler tick's retention pass.

The pass exists because nothing else calls ``prune_old_data`` on a schedule:
before this, every prune came from an admin route someone had to invoke, so an
installation nobody administered grew without bound.

What makes it more than an interval timer is where the interval is measured
from. Anchoring on process start would mean a daemon restarted more often than
the interval never prunes at all, and starting the counter at zero, the way the
reaper and checkpoint passes do, would put a prune in the middle of daemon
startup on every restart. It reads back when a prune last committed instead,
including prunes this process did not run.

The tick starts the pass and moves on. How much the sweep has to do is set by
however much eligible data has accumulated, and nothing bounds that, so a tick
that waited for it would stop delivering dispatches and evaluating schedules
for the duration.
