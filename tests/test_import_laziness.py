"""Import-time laziness regression gate.

``lionagi/__init__.py`` uses a ``_LAZY_MAP`` + ``__getattr__`` scheme (see
``lionagi.ln._lazy_init``) so a bare ``import lionagi`` stays cheap --
provider SDKs, the CLI command tree, and the flow engine load only once a
caller touches them. A stray top-level import (added for a type checker, a
convenience re-export, an eager shortcut deep in the import graph) can defeat
that without failing any normal unit test -- the only symptom is slower
startup and heavier memory for every consumer. This module runs ``import
lionagi`` in a fresh subprocess (so no other test has warmed
``sys.modules``) and pins the known-good module set and timing, so a
regression trips CI immediately.
