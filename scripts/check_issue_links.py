"""Check that a PR body says what happens to every phase-tracking issue it references.

Phase-tracking issues are opened in bulk when an ADR lands, one per phase, and
each closes when its phase ships. That only happens if the PR body spells a
closing keyword, so this asserts it does, or that the author declared the
reference deliberate with a ``Refs-only:`` line.

Usage: ``uv run python scripts/check_issue_links.py``, reading PR_BODY,
PR_BRANCH and REPO from the environment.
