"""The exclusive claim a finalizer holds while it closes out a manifest round.

Non-blocking ``flock`` on ``{run_dir}/finalize.lock``; a dead holder's claim
vanishes with it (takeover IS acquisition — no stale-lock repair path). The
descriptor must never reach a spawned leg (``O_CLOEXEC``), and the claim
itself decides nothing — every claimant re-reads state after acquiring
rather than trusting what it observed before. See ``docs/internals/cli.md``
(`_finalize.py`) for why both properties are load-bearing.
