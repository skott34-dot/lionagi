"""ADR-0071 D4/D5: the local (host-only) worker/claim loop with capability
matching.

v1 ships ONE worker (the Studio daemon engine itself). A claim is one
guarded CAS via ``lionagi.state.transitions.transition()`` (``queued ->
running``) that also sets ``leased_by``/``lease_expires_at``/
``lease_attempts`` in the same UPDATE. Execution resolves through
``lionagi.studio.scheduler.subprocess``; this module never spawns a process
itself.

D4's ``workers`` registry heartbeats before every claim pass and matches a
queued row's ``required_capabilities``/``execution_target`` against this
worker's advertised ones; a row this worker can't serve is left ``queued``.
D3's per-row admission predicate lives in
``lionagi.studio.scheduler.admit.admit()`` -- a terminal
``AdmissionDecision`` transitions ``queued -> skipped`` and, if a notify
request was declared, emits a ``dispatch_outbox`` notification.
