"""Strict stdio MCP bridge for real Studio Operator application tools.

The bridge exposes a deliberately small capability set. Read tools return
bounded projections, UI tools only append durable ADR-0083 effects, and the
single launch tool creates a durable proposal then waits for the daemon's
authenticated human-decision path. It never accepts a URL, filesystem path,
shell command, or raw endpoint.
