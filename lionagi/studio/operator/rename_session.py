"""Studio Operator lifecycle service/adapter, exposed to the Operator as
the ``rename_run`` tool.

The module and its internals keep the ``rename_session`` name (the durable
``command_type`` must stay stable across pending proposals), but the
tool's catalog name says *run* like every sibling (``cancel_run``,
``resume_run``): a run and its session are the same ``sessions`` row, and
a name that suggests otherwise invites the caller to refuse the rename
while hunting for a "session id" that is the id it already has.

Gives one Studio run (a `sessions` row) a human name through the Operator,
gated on the same durable human allow/deny proposal flow `cancel_run` and
`resume_run` use. Deliberately distinct from renaming the Operator's own
*conversation* (`store.py::update_conversation`, a direct human UI/REST
action) -- see docs/internals/studio.md ("Turn identity and the
propose/poll/execute pattern"). Reuses `run_progress.py::resolve_run` for
reference resolution rather than a third private copy of that logic.
