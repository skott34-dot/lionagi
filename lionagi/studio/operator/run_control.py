"""Human-approved Studio Operator adapters for live run controls.

These tools enqueue the same ``session_controls`` verbs as ``li o ctl``.
They do not call an in-memory executor directly: the live run remains the
single consumer, and the existing queue keeps pause/resume idempotence and
message claim semantics intact.

What stops a control here, stated once so it is not re-derived from the
individual checks below:

Nothing in this module mutates a run on its own. Every verb creates a proposal
and then blocks until a person confirms or denies it, and the summary they are
shown names the run and the project it belongs to. That confirmation is the
authorization step. The Studio API around it is a local surface: it binds to
loopback by default and its only credential, ``LIONAGI_STUDIO_AUTH_TOKEN``, is
one token for the whole daemon -- it answers whether a client may talk to
Studio at all, not which projects it owns. There is no per-project identity
anywhere in the operator surface, so the project a turn is scoped to is chosen,
somewhere up the chain, by the same person who confirms the proposal.

The project fence below is therefore a blast-radius bound rather than a
privilege boundary, and it is worth having as one: it keeps a turn from naming
a run outside the conversation it is working in, which is the realistic way a
control reaches the wrong run. It is deliberately not described as proving
ownership, because it cannot -- calling it that would leave a reader expecting
a boundary that the surrounding system does not implement.
