"""``run_progress`` Operator read tool and the shared run-reference resolver.

Resolves a human-supplied run reference (a run/session id, an id prefix, a
name/playbook substring, or ``"current"``) to at most one session, then
reports how far that run's operations have gotten. Every number here is a
direct read of stored state — it reflects what the database recorded, not
necessarily a live process (see the ``freshness`` field). ``resolve_run`` is
also imported by ``run_findings.py``, ``resume_run.py``, and
``rename_session.py`` so every tool accepts the same reference vocabulary --
