"""Studio Operator lifecycle service/adapter: ``resume_run``.

Delegates to the real, supported ``POST /runs/{run_id}/resume`` surface
(`lionagi/studio/services/run_resume.py::resume_run`) for the actual launch
decision -- this adapter never picks an argv or a resume path itself. It
does read the run's recorded ``invocation_kind`` before creating a proposal,
so the proposal's summary says the true thing the dispatcher is about to do
and an argument combination the dispatcher would reject (e.g. an
instruction for a checkpoint-replay kind) is refused before a human ever
sees an approvable proposal for it. Gated on the same durable human
allow/deny proposal flow ``cancel_run``/``launch_playbook`` use, since it
starts a new process. See docs/internals/studio.md ("Turn identity and the
propose/poll/execute pattern") for why this is a distinct operation from
un-pausing a paused or cancelled run, and accepts a run in any status.

RESUME_RUN_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Continue a run through the same path a human resuming from the CLI or "
    "Studio uses. An 'agent' run continues its existing conversation branch "
    "with a new instruction, through `li agent -r`; requires an instruction, "
    "and resolves to exactly one branch unless a branch id is given "
    "explicitly. A 'play', 'flow', or 'show-play' run instead replays its "
    "persisted checkpoint through `li o flow --resume` -- the checkpoint "
    "owns the plan, so instruction and branch are rejected for those kinds; "
    "set allow_degraded_context only to proceed past a refusal that exists "
    "to protect conversational context, and retry_failed only to run ops the "
    "checkpoint recorded as failed again, which re-executes whatever side "
    "effects their first attempt already had. This is not an un-pause of a paused "
    "or cancelled run: the run lifecycle has no edge back out of a terminal "
    "status for that, so this always launches a new invocation rather than "
    "reopening the old run's status. Works on a run in any status, including "
    "completed, failed, or cancelled ones. Goes through a human approval "
    "flow; it is never automatic, and a denied proposal starts nothing. "
    "Accepts a run UUID, an 8+ hex id prefix, a name substring (minimum 3 "
    "characters), or 'current' for the run open when this instruction was "
    "sent. Ambiguous references return candidates rather than guessing."
