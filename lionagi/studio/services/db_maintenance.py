    The scan reads one chunk at a time instead of every eligible id at once,
    so a pass holds at most *size* ids however far the aged backlog has grown.
    Each chunk is read in its own short transaction, which keeps the selection
    off the write lock the chunk deletes then take.

    The cursor advances by id rather than by "what is still eligible", because
    a chunk can legitimately delete nothing: `_prune_session_chunk` re-checks
    each row under the write lock and skips one that stopped being terminal.
    Re-asking the same question would hand that row back forever.

    The primary key index is named explicitly because leaving the choice to the
    planner makes this loop quadratic. Left alone, and with no collected
    statistics -- which is the permanent state here, since nothing runs ANALYZE
    -- SQLite prefers the narrower status/time index and then sorts for the
    ORDER BY, so every page re-reads and re-sorts the whole remaining eligible
    backlog instead of seeking past the ids it already returned. Measured on a
    240k-row store, walking the backlog took 43.8s that way against 0.12s
    seeking the primary key. Naming the index turns each page back into a
    forward seek, and asking for one that does not exist is a prepare-time
    error, so a schema change that removes it fails loudly rather than
    silently restoring the quadratic plan.

    The hint is SQLite's syntax and SQLite's problem, so it is only emitted for
    that dialect. PostgreSQL keeps its own table statistics and plans this as a
    forward seek without being told, and it has no `INDEXED BY` clause at all --
    emitting one unconditionally would turn every prune pass on a Postgres-backed
    store into a syntax error at prepare time.
