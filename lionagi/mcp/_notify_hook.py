"""Terminal hook for background MCP jobs, invoked by the CLI via ``--notify``.

Runs once a background run reaches a terminal status, both steps best-effort
(the run has already finished; nothing here may raise into the CLI's terminal
path):

1. Records the terminal status on the MCP job record, so ``job.status`` /
   ``job.list`` report an authoritative status instead of only inferring
   ``exited`` from a gone pid.
2. Delivers a terminal notice through a *configured* command (``--command``
   override, or lionagi's ``notify.on_terminal`` setting) with ``{run_id}``/
   ``{status}``/``{label}``/``{target}`` substituted into argv and offered as
   JSON on stdin. Nothing configured means silent by default; configured but
   unusable is recorded as a delivery failure, never passed off as silence.
   Runs in the *submitting* directory (``LIONAGI_MCP_NOTIFY_CWD`` overrides),
   not wherever the run executed, so the notifier signs as the submitter.

Run by absolute argv, never through a shell.
