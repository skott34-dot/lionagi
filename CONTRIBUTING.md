# Contributing to LionAGI

Thank you for considering contributing to LionAGI! This document provides
guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub
   account. This creates your own copy of the project where you can make
   changes.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine
   to start working on the changes.

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Ensure you have a suitable Python
   development environment. Any IDE that supports Python and package
   installation should be sufficient.

## Making Changes

1. **Creating Branches**: For new features or bug fixes, create a new branch off
   the main branch. Branch names should be descriptive and reflect the feature
   or fix you are working on.

2. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. While
   there’s no strict format, ensure your messages convey the purpose of the
   commit.

## Submitting Contributions

1. **Pull Requests**: Once you are ready with your changes, push your branch to
   your fork and open a pull request against the main repository.

2. **Pull Request Description**: Provide a detailed description of the changes
   in your pull request. Link it to any relevant issues.

3. **Code Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the project
   maintainers. Feedback may be provided for improvements.

4. **Merging**: After approval, one of the maintainers will merge your pull
   request. No direct merges into the main branch are allowed without approval.

5. **Phase issues**: when an ADR is accepted, one issue is opened per phase of
   its rollout. If your PR finishes one, say so with a closing keyword in the
   body, `Closes #NNNN`, so the issue closes when the work lands rather than
   waiting for someone to notice. If your PR only mentions a phase, name it on
   its own line instead:

   ```text
   Refs-only: #NNNN
   ```

   The `Issue links` check enforces this, and one of the two is always
   available, so it never asks you to claim work you did not do. A closing
   keyword on a PR stacked under another branch is still correct: GitHub fires
   it once the stack drains and the last PR retargets `main`. Write the keyword
   when the work lands, not when the base does.

   Write the keyword plainly. "Does not close #NNNN" is refused rather than
   read as a non-closure, because GitHub's own parser ignores the negation and
   closes the issue on merge regardless. Rewrite the sentence without the
   keyword: a `Refs-only:` line satisfies this check but not GitHub, so the
   issue would still close. A body naming more than 40 issue numbers is refused
   rather than partly checked.

## Testing

1. **Writing Tests**: Include unit and integration tests for your code. Tests
   mirror the package layout (`lionagi/<area>/x.py` → `tests/<area>/test_x.py`)
   and are tagged with markers (`unit`, `integration`, `slow`, `performance`,
   `asyncio`, `property`, `migration`, `network`). Every behavioral change needs
   a test in the same patch; changes to a trust boundary (auth, paths, URLs,
   untrusted input) need a fail-closed regression test.

2. **Running Tests Locally**: Run `uv run pytest` (parallel, `-n auto`) before
   submitting. Use `uv run pytest tests/<file>.py -v` for a focused run and
   `uv run pytest -n0 -s ...` to debug. Performance-sensitive changes are
   gated in CI by a same-machine A/B comparison, not a frozen baseline file.
   See `benchmarks/README.md`'s "CI gating (same-machine A/B)" section for
   how the baseline/current result JSONs are produced
   (`benchmarks/run_paired_ab.py`) before `benchmarks/ci_compare.py` diffs
   them. Running `ci_compare.py --baseline ... --current ...` directly
   requires both result files to already exist; it exits 1, not a graceful
   skip, if either is missing, since a missing baseline in CI means the A/B
   setup itself failed rather than "nothing to gate on".

## Coding Standards

1. **Formatting & linting are automated by [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).**
   Run `uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check --fix .`, or
   `pre-commit run -a` for the full pipeline (file sanity hooks, ruff-format,
   ruff, pyupgrade, markdownlint, and frontend/marketplace hooks when relevant).
   `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml` is the source of truth — line length
   **100**, target `py310`. CI tests Python 3.10 and 3.14 on PRs, and 3.10-3.14
   on `main`/`develop` pushes. Merging into `main` requires the `ci-gate`
   status check, which aggregates every PR-facing CI job.

2. **PEP 8 / PEP 257**: follow standard style and docstring conventions; ruff's
   `E F W B I UP N S A` rule set enforces most of this (incl. import sorting,
   pyupgrade, naming, and bandit security checks).

3. **Conventions**: new or materially changed Python files under `lionagi/`
   should keep/add the Apache-2.0 SPDX header,
   `from __future__ import annotations`, and an `__all__` tuple for public
   surface. This is an async-first SDK — no blocking I/O in async paths.

4. **Public-surface changes**: removing or renaming anything in `__all__`,
   documented hook names, CLI flags, or provider identifiers requires the
   deprecation path (alias + `DeprecationWarning` + CHANGELOG entry, minimum
   one minor release before removal). See
   [docs/governance/standards/deprecation-policy.md](docs/governance/standards/deprecation-policy.md).

5. **Reuse before you create**: prefer existing abstractions
   (`lionagi.ln` utilities, `Pile`/`Progression`/`Element`, `iModel`) over
   introducing parallel ones. Prefer LionAGI-native primitives over naked
   stdlib/third-party calls when a local helper exists (`alcall`/`bcall` over
   raw gather loops, `json_dumps`/`fuzzy_json` over direct `json` on
   model/provider payloads, `now_utc`/`to_uuid` over ad hoc time/UUID handling).
   Keep changes surgical.

## Dependencies

1. **Managing Dependencies**: Do not add or update dependencies without prior
   approval from the maintainers.

## Documentation

1. **Update Documentation**: Accompany your code changes with corresponding
   updates in the documentation.

2. **Versioning Documentation**: Documentation should be versioned alongside the
   code.

## Community Interaction

1. **Using Discord**: Use the project’s Discord for discussions, questions, and
   collaboration.

## Acknowledging Contributions

1. **Recognition**: We value your contributions and will acknowledge significant
   contributions in our social media and release notes.

2. **GitHub Sponsors**: We are considering setting up a GitHub Sponsor button to
   enable sponsorship for our contributors.
