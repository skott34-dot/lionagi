# Architecture Decision Records

This directory is the canonical ADR corpus for lionagi. It replaces the earlier corpus now
preserved at `docs/_archive/v0/` (moved there intact, original filenames kept). Every archived
record has an explicit disposition — carried forward into a new ADR, merged into one, or
retired — recorded in `dispositions.yaml` in this directory (one row per archived record).

Each ADR follows `TEMPLATE.md` and is exactly one of two kinds:

- **Retrospective** — records what the code does today, honestly, including a
  current-vs-ideal delta table whose rows are phrased to lift directly into issues.
- **Aspirational** — records a target state that is decided but not yet implemented.

A gap between a retrospective truth and an aspirational target is an issue, never a blurred
document.

Kind describes what the document is and never changes as code lands. How much of a decided
target has actually shipped is recorded in the separate, mutable `Implementation-status`
header field (see `TEMPLATE.md`), updated as implementation progresses without a formal
amendment.

## Status lifecycle

An ADR is authored `Proposed`. The flip to `Accepted` has an owner and a trigger: **the PR
that merges the ADR's first dependent implementation also flips its status**, and whoever
merges that PR owns the flip. When an implementation has already merged while the record
still reads `Proposed`, the correction is an immediate docs follow-up, not a debt to
accumulate. Decisions inside one ADR are separable: where only some decision clauses have
shipped or one clause is blocked on an external dependency, the status line says so
per-clause and `Implementation-status` names what landed and what remains.

## Architecture-quality figures (κ and τ)

Several ADRs report two figures in their Consequences sections. κ is a coupling density:
directed dependencies divided by n × (n − 1) over the components that ADR's own design diagram
names, where a component is a named box and an edge is a direct dependency drawn in that
diagram. τ is an estimated fraction of components testable in isolation through their declared
seams. Both are the author's structural reading of the recorded design: arithmetically
consistent within each ADR, not independently re-derived from source, and not comparable
across ADRs whose component maps differ in granularity. Read them as review aids for the
specific component map shown, not as corpus-wide measurements.

## Numbering

Numbers are allocated in per-area blocks so areas can be authored independently without
collisions. Unused numbers inside a block are intentional gaps, not missing documents.

| Area | Block | Area | Block |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| core-data-model | 0001-0005 | persistence-state | 0055-0061 |
| messages-context | 0006-0010 | cli-surface | 0062-0067 |
| actions-tools | 0011-0015 | scheduling-control-plane | 0068-0075 |
| session-branch | 0016-0020 | studio | 0076-0085 |
| operations | 0021-0026 | governance | 0086-0089 |
| service-providers | 0027-0032 | substrates | 0090-0095 |
| orchestration | 0033-0040 | agent-roles | 0041-0046 |
| hooks | 0047-0049 | utilities | 0050-0054 |

ADR-0094 and ADR-0095 are documented numbering exceptions: both retain numbers from the
substrates block (0090-0095) despite declaring `scheduling-control-plane` as their area.
They landed in that range before the area mismatch was identified; retaining the numbers
avoids collisions with other ADR work and preserves existing inbound references.

ADR-0104 is a documented numbering exception for the same reason: it declares `cli-surface`
but carries a number far outside that block (0062-0067), which was allocated before the
per-area scheme was applied to it. It is indexed under cli-surface and keeps its number, so
inbound references stay valid.

Numbers 0096-0103 belong to no area block and are reserved but unused: they fall between the
end of the block regime (0095) and the start of the sequential regime (0104), and no document
will be created to fill them.

From ADR-0104 onward, numbers are in practice allocated **sequentially** rather than from the
area block, and each such record is indexed under the area it declares. This is a description
of what the corpus does, not a second scheme competing with the blocks: the blocks still hold
for 0001-0095, and every number is unique either way. A record numbered past 0104 carries a
"sequential number" note in the index so a reader is not left to reconcile its number against
its area block.

### cli-orchestration (sequential numbers only)

Ratified 2026-08-11 as the seventeenth area: the CLI orchestration surface — `li o flow` /
`li o fanout`, playbooks and flow definitions, orchestration guidance packs. It postdates
the block regime, so it holds no number block; its records carry sequential numbers (≥0104).

- [ADR-0114](ADR-0114-executable-flow-definition-and-role-capabilities.md) — An executable
  flow definition, and roles whose declared capabilities are real (sequential number; see
  Numbering)
- [ADR-0115](ADR-0115-orchestration-guidance-as-an-enforced-pack.md) — Orchestration
  guidance as an enforced pack (sequential number; see Numbering)

Remaining areas land here as their records are accepted.

Status-set literals quoted in these records (terminal sets, valid-status vocabularies) are
checked against the lifecycle policy registry in CI (`scripts/check_adr_status_sets.py`);
a registry change that stale-ifies a quoted set fails the docs job.
