# ADR-0119: Deterministic declaration and configuration substrate

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Kind**: Aspirational
- **Implementation-status**: partial — `Params` honors declared dataclass defaults and
  per-instance `default_factory` values; `Params` and `DataClass` share ordered instance-field
  discovery, exclude `ClassVar` declarations, serialize in declaration order, and preserve full
  declared public-field state across updates; `Operable` selection and legacy `OperableModel`
  materialization retain declaration order, and multiple unnamed specs are accepted; legacy
  sentinel collapse is isolated behind a closed compatibility inventory; lightweight JSON
  projection delegates nested values to LionAGI's internal serializer, and omitted `Spec` base
  types are `Undefined`; `Params`, `Meta`, and `Spec` use one typed structural equality/hash
  projection, production declarations use the explicit `eq=False` authority, and declaration,
  field-layout, sentinel, singleton, annotation, and Pydantic model caches use identity-safe keys;
  mutable `DataClass`/`HashableModel` migration, registry snapshots, and canonical durable
  serialization remain open
- **Area**: utilities
- **Date**: 2026-08-16
- **Relations**: extends ADR-0050 (foundational utility and typed adaptation strata); required
  by ADR-0118 (declared entity schema) and the subsequent dispatch, harness, modularity, and Run
  records

## Context

LionAGI already has the right foundational vocabulary. `Undefined` and `Unset` distinguish
absence from a present-but-unresolved parameter. `Params` and `DataClass` distinguish immutable
configuration from mutable runtime state. `Spec` describes a field without committing to a
validation framework, and `Operable` holds an ordered set of those descriptions. ADR-0050
records those intended strata accurately.

The rest of the repository nevertheless authors configuration and wire contracts as unrelated
Pydantic models, plain dataclasses, dictionaries, string enums, and hand-written serializers.
ADR-0118 would make that worse if it introduced a second frozen schema-spec hierarchy without
first making the existing one safe for schema hashes, migrations, policy snapshots, and generated
wire models.

The current foundation also contains defects that are harmless in some dynamic-model uses and
fatal when it becomes an authority.

**P1 — `Params` does not honor declared dataclass defaults.** Its custom constructor sets only
caller-provided keywords and then changes remaining `Undefined` values to `Unset`. A declared
literal default or `default_factory` is therefore bypassed. Existing agent mode parameters can
construct with `behaviors is Unset` even though the dataclass declares an empty-string default.
Configuration cannot be canonical if omitting a field produces a different value from the field
declaration.

**P2 — ordered declarations become unordered at selection boundaries.** `Operable` stores a
tuple, but `get_specs(include=...)` iterates the caller's set. `OperableModel.new_model` converts
an ordered field collection to a set again. The loss reproduces: on a four-field `Operable`
declared `alpha, beta, gamma, delta`, `get_specs(include={"delta", "alpha", "gamma"})` returns
`('delta', 'gamma', 'alpha')`, which is not a subsequence of declaration order, and different
`PYTHONHASHSEED` values reorder it again.

Today that reaches generated field order, and it does not yet reach the hash. `Params.__hash__`
routes through `hash_dict`, whose `_generate_hashable_representation` sorts mapping items, so a
set-ordered `to_dict()` produces the same digest as a declaration-ordered one. The masking is
accidental: it depends on one helper sorting on the way past, and it disappears the moment any
consumer hashes the emitted order rather than the mapping. That is an argument for D7's separate
canonical-bytes surface, not a reason to leave the loss in place, and it is the reason the defect
is currently invisible to tests. Where the order does escape unmasked, it invalidates a schema
hash, migration plan, signed policy snapshot, or generated API contract.

**P3 — equality and hashing do not share one projection.** `Meta` can compare two dictionaries
as equal while hashing their different string renderings. Equal `Meta` and `Spec` objects can
therefore occupy separate set entries. `Params.__eq__` and `DataClass.__eq__` compare only their
hashes, so a collision can make unequal values equal, and a subclass reaches that behavior only
when it declares `eq=False`; the default `@dataclass(frozen=True)` decoration shadows it with a
generated `__eq__` instead. Which of the two semantics a declaration gets is decided by a
decorator argument rather than by the base class, which D4 closes. `HashableModel` is mutable
while its hash depends on its content; mutation after insertion breaks set and dictionary
membership.

**P4 — the unnamed-field contract is accidental.** `Operable` intends to enforce uniqueness
only among declared names. It filters `None` but not `Undefined`, so two unnamed `Spec` objects
are rejected as duplicate `Undefined` names. A low-level field description should be allowed to
remain unnamed until an adapter that requires a name materializes it.

**P5 — framework and storage concerns leak back into the neutral layer.** The current
`Spec -> FieldModel -> FieldInfo -> model builder` path is duplicated by mutable
`OperableModel`. Production ReAct code still constructs the latter. ADR-0118 needs SQLAlchemy,
codec, foreign-key, index, and migration information, but placing SQLAlchemy objects or a second
storage-only field class in `ln.types` would reverse the dependency direction ADR-0050 protects.

**P6 — registration is often an import side effect.** Self-registering entities and global hook
or provider catalogs make the effective contract depend on which optional modules happened to
import first. That conflicts with deterministic schema generation and with an SDK installation
that does not load StateDB, CLI, Studio, or providers.

**P7 — the Krons reference demonstrates the intended composition but is not a source-port.** Its
field/type metadata and adapter separation are useful. It also retains set-ordered allowed keys,
content-dependent mutable hashes, and at least one validation path where a custom constructor
prevents `__post_init__` from running. Porting the files would copy the exact failure class this
record removes. The rule is the same as ADR-0118: port the pattern, not the file.

**P8 — runtime hashability is not durable identity.** Python `hash()` is process-local, callable
identity has no cross-process meaning, and omission-oriented `to_dict()` cannot both hide unresolved
fields and prove a signed/persisted snapshot is resolved. Dependent ADRs need a named byte and
digest contract rather than assuming `__hash__` or ordinary wire JSON is one.

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| Absence | D1: `Undefined`, `Unset`, and `None` remain three distinct states with one shared serialization rule. |
| State shape | D2: `Params` is immutable configuration; `DataClass` is mutable runtime context; declared defaults are honored. |
| Order | D3: declaration order is canonical and survives selection, composition, serialization, hashing, and adapter emission. |
| Equality and hashing | D4: equality compares structural values, hashing uses the same canonical projection, mutable values are unhashable, and the subclass decoration that decides which implementation is in force is fixed rather than left to each declaration. |
| Field/schema composition | D5: `Spec` describes one field and `Operable` one ordered shape; domain adapters add Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, wire, or policy semantics. |
| Registries | D6: registries are explicitly composed immutable snapshots; imports never mutate the active contract. |
| Durable identity | D7: resolved snapshots have one versioned canonical-byte envelope and digest; runtime `__hash__` is never persisted. |
| Enforcement | D8: cross-process determinism, house-rule imports, compatibility, and mutation tests are merge gates. |

This record deliberately does not decide:

- the persistence entity vocabulary, physical schema, or migration algorithm; ADR-0118 owns it;
- hook phases, action authorization, provider capability policy, or Run fields; their ADRs consume
  this substrate;
- whether Pydantic remains the public SDK modeling library; it remains an adapter/materialization
  target;
- a universal base class for every LionAGI object. In particular, persistence rows do not become
  `Element` merely to reuse serialization;
- a multi-distribution package split. This record makes such a split possible but does not choose
  one.

## Decision

### D1 — Three absence states have one meaning everywhere

The canonical states remain:

```python
Undefined  # the key or field is not part of this input/projection
Unset      # the parameter exists but is unresolved; inherit or resolve later
None       # the caller explicitly supplied null / no value
```

Identity, not truthiness, distinguishes sentinels. `False`, `0`, `""`, and empty containers are
ordinary values unless a domain-specific adapter explicitly declares otherwise. New core
configuration must not enable `none_as_sentinel` or `empty_as_sentinel`.

Those two flags survive for compatibility adapters whose old contracts already collapse those
values, and the set of adapters allowed to set them is a closed enumerated list, not a capability
any adapter may claim. The list lives beside the flags as a module-level constant of call-site
identifiers; a call site absent from it raises rather than collapsing, and the D8 gate fails a
diff that sets either flag from a site the list does not name. Adding a site is an edit to that
constant, reviewed as a contract change. Otherwise the carve-out grows by usage and the
three-state rule becomes advisory in exactly the places that already had the loosest contracts.

The supported public helpers implement identity semantics only and reject either legacy flag.
`Params` and `DataClass` resolve the first class that declares their `ModelConfig` and validate
each enabled axis against the inventory before applying it. Named direct adapters use the same
private gateway. A static repository gate binds each private call's literal identifier to its
lexical owner and requires the discovered inventory to equal the constant. The identifier is an
architectural compatibility control, not a security credential: importing a private function and
spoofing its string is unsupported, and frame inspection is deliberately avoided. The gate covers
supported direct imports, declarations, re-exports, and assignments; reflective dynamic import,
`eval` / `exec`, and deliberate runtime metadata forgery are outside this non-security contract.

The wire rule is explicit:

```python
def to_dict(
    self,
    exclude: Collection[str] | None = None,
    *,
    mode: Literal["python", "json"] = "python",
) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
```

- `Undefined` and `Unset` are omitted from this application/wire projection only; omission does not
  make the object eligible for a durable identity.
- `None` is emitted as `None`/JSON `null`.
- Enum conversion, paths, timestamps, UUIDs, and nested models use the selected internal
  serialization adapter; individual models do not hand-write a second recursion. Pydantic values
  use their JSON-mode serializers. Raw bytes remain rejected until D7 defines their versioned
  durable representation.
- JSON projection rejects non-finite numbers instead of allowing a serializer to turn them into a
  `null` indistinguishable from explicit `None`.
- Deserialization never guesses `Unset` from `null`. A missing key and a present null key remain
  distinguishable.
- Omitting `Spec.base_type` stores `Undefined`; explicit `Spec(None)` is invalid. Legacy
  `FieldModel(annotation=None)` is normalized to `Unset` only at that adapter boundary.
- Omission belongs to the declaring model's projection. Code must call `to_dict(mode="json")`
  before handing an unresolved lightweight declaration to the raw JSON encoder; a raw dataclass
  traversal has no field-owner contract and fails on a nested sentinel rather than inventing one.
- `Spec.metadata` entries are nested values, not independently declared `Spec` fields. A sentinel
  stored inside `Meta.value` therefore fails closed until the caller resolves or excludes that
  metadata entry; core projection does not silently drop a default, validator, or other contract.
- Core JSON projection does not invent a wire identity for a resolved Python `type`, validator, or
  default factory. Those values fail closed until a D5 target adapter materializes them or D7
  encodes a versioned `CallableRef`.
- Patch/update APIs may use `Unset` to mean “leave unchanged”; create APIs resolve every required
  `Unset` before crossing their owner boundary.
- A persisted or signed snapshot uses D7's distinct strict `to_snapshot(require_resolved=True)`
  surface, contains no sentinel, and raises a typed resolution error naming every unresolved
  `Unset` field path.

This gives provider inheritance, optional MCP lists, permission profiles, schema defaults, and
Run snapshots the same absence semantics. A surface that needs a fourth state defines a domain
enum rather than reinterpreting a sentinel.

### D2 — `Params` is immutable configuration and `DataClass` is mutable context

`Params` and `DataClass` share field discovery, default application, validation, and
serialization mechanics through private helpers. They differ deliberately in mutability and
hashability.

Target constructor behavior is equivalent to dataclass construction:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True, init=False, eq=False)
class Params:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ...

@dataclass(slots=True)
class DataClass:
    def __post_init__(self) -> None: ...
```

For each declared field, in declaration order:

1. use the supplied keyword when present;
2. otherwise call its `default_factory` once when one exists;
3. otherwise use its declared literal default;
4. otherwise use `Unset` only when `prefill_unset=True`;
5. otherwise leave it `Undefined`;
6. when `strict=True`, reject a remaining sentinel with a field-qualified error.

Unknown keywords are rejected before any factory runs. A factory that raises propagates its
exception without leaving a partially returned object. Factories are never executed at class
definition time or canonical-serialization time.

The ownership rule is:

- `Params`: immutable configuration, registration, dispatch policy, permission policy,
  `EntitySpec`, `RunSpec`, and adapter options;
- `DataClass`: mutable invocation context, accumulating evidence, counters, and transient
  execution state;
- Pydantic model: validated public/wire DTO when Pydantic behavior is part of the boundary;
- `Element`: runtime object that actually needs LionAGI identity, creation time, and polymorphic
  envelope;
- plain dataclass: local implementation detail with none of the substrate behavior.

`DataClass` is unhashable unless a concrete frozen subclass supplies an explicit immutable
structural key. The base never promises hashability for mutable state.

### D3 — Declaration order is canonical

Field order comes from `dataclasses.fields(cls)` and `Operable.__op_fields__`, never a set or
mapping created along the way.

The compatibility and ordered APIs are distinct:

```python
@classmethod
def field_names(cls) -> tuple[str, ...]: ...

@classmethod
def allowed(cls) -> frozenset[str]: ...  # membership compatibility only

class Operable:
    def get_specs(
        self,
        *,
        include: Collection[str] | None = None,
        exclude: Collection[str] | None = None,
    ) -> tuple[Spec, ...]: ...
```

`to_dict()` iterates `field_names()`. `get_specs(include=...)` treats include as membership and
filters the stored tuple, so output order is declaration order regardless of whether the caller
passed a set, list, or tuple. `exclude` does the same. Supplying both remains an error. Unknown
names are reported in deterministic sorted order.

Composition is left-biased and explicit:

```python
def compose(*operables: Operable, name: str | None = None) -> Operable: ...
```

- specs appear in operand order and within each operand's declaration order;
- duplicate declared names are rejected with both source positions;
- multiple unnamed specs are permitted;
- an adapter requiring names rejects unnamed specs at materialization time;
- no implicit alphabetical sort occurs;
- a domain that needs a different order creates an explicit reordered `Operable`, making the
  semantic change visible in its hash and review diff.

Canonical JSON sorts mapping keys only inside values whose mapping order is not semantic. It does
not sort declared field arrays, index key arrays, hook stages, policy chains, or graph edges whose
order carries meaning.

### D4 — Equality and hash use one structural projection

`Params`, `Spec`, `Meta`, and immutable registry values expose one private recursive projection.
It separates three questions that raw Python tuples conflate: whether two values are structurally
equal, whether the live graph is safe to hash, and whether retaining a key can safely share a
materialized cache entry:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class _StructuralKey:
    value: Hashable
    hash_safe: bool
    cache_stable: bool

def _structural_key(value: Any) -> _StructuralKey: ...
def _try_stable_cache_key(value: Any) -> _StructuralKey | None: ...

def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
    return type(self) is type(other) and self._key() == other._key()

def __hash__(self) -> int:
    return hash(self._key().require_hashable())
```

The projection rules are:

- every scalar carries an exact type tag, so `True`, `1`, and `1.0` are distinct; floats use their
  IEEE-754 bits, including signed zero and NaN payload; integers use width-minimal two's complement
  rather than their digits, because the interpreter caps integer-to-string conversion and a
  declaration must compare rather than raise; `Ellipsis` remains an immutable singleton;
- exact `dict` values become key/value projections sorted by framed structural order tokens, while
  a mapping of any other type is opaque, because nothing about a `Mapping` implementation says
  whether `items()` is all of it; lists and tuples preserve order and retain their different
  collection kinds; sets and frozensets are sorted by those same tokens and retain their different
  kinds;
- a live `dict`, `list`, or `set` remains structurally comparable but makes its owner unhashable
  and cache-ineligible. A tuple or frozenset is safe only when every descendant is safe. This
  prevents a shallow-frozen `Params` from changing hash after a nested mutation. User collection
  subclasses remain opaque because they can attach or expose additional mutable state;
- enums include their concrete enum type and canonicalized value;
- typing forms recurse through their arguments; the interpreter-owned parameter list exposed by
  `Callable[[...], result]` is normalized as immutable syntax rather than mistaken for user state,
  and the available public `Any`/`NoReturn`/`Never`/`Self`/`LiteralString` singletons have explicit
  tags across their different Python 3.10–3.14 runtime representations;
- the closed stdlib `pathlib` concrete types and exact `UUID` are recognized immutable value
  atoms: their concrete type is part of the key, POSIX path parts retain case, and Windows path
  parts use the case-lowering of path equality. User subclasses remain opaque/cache-ineligible
  because they may add mutable state;
- dataclass owners include exact concrete type identity and their declared fields; mutable
  dataclasses and Pydantic models are structurally comparable but not hash/cache-safe;
- callables compare and hash by identity, and the key holds that identity weakly wherever the
  runtime permits a weak reference, so a key can be kept without keeping its target alive. The
  hash is the address taken while the target was alive and stays usable after it dies; equality
  requires both referents to be live, so an address the interpreter has reused cannot collide with
  a dead entry. Plain functions and types are cache-stable because identity is a sound key for
  them; bound methods, partials, and callable instances are never cache-stable, because sharing
  would retain mutable receiver state. Their unordered runtime ordering token uses identity, never
  the writable `__module__` and `__qualname__` presentation attributes;
- unsupported unhashable opaque values compare by identity and raise
  `UnhashableStructuralValueError` with their path when a hash is requested; cycles fail with the
  same typed path error. Cache admission converts that error into an uncached materialization,
  never a user-visible construction failure.
- the two Lion sentinels are recognized by exact singleton identity, never by spoofable module or
  class names;
- unsupported hashable opaque values also compare by identity and are cache-ineligible: arbitrary
  user hash/equality implementations are not treated as proof of recursive immutability.

The substrate no longer calls the public compatibility hashes in `lionagi/ln/_hash.py`, whose
unrecognized-value path renders through `str(item)` and then `repr(item)`. Those public helpers
remain available for audited compatibility consumers until their own migration; D4 deletes the
substrate dependency, not the public API.

Hash equality is never used as object equality. Equal objects must hash equal; unequal objects
may still collide without becoming equal. Structurally equal values containing mutable containers
are both unhashable; the Python equal-hash invariant therefore does not license a mutable content
hash.

The same projection owns declaration-cache admission. `Spec` and `FieldModel` share one bounded
annotation cache keyed by the exact whole declaration; effective sentinel/nullable policy is
applied atomically only on a miss. Stable Pydantic model declarations use the same atomic
get-or-create contract, so concurrent callers receive one class identity. The materializer uses
the runtime's uncached `typing._AnnotatedAlias` constructor behind one private compatibility
function because public
`typing.Annotated[...]` has its own equality-based global cache and can return the wrong origin for
custom metaclasses. Python 3.10–3.14 contract tests pin that isolated private dependency. Pydantic
model keys include adapter-class identity, base-model identity, model name, the final ordered
declaration projection, and documentation; the already-projected spec order makes raw
`include`/`exclude` selectors redundant. A separate bounded stable-declaration projection cache
keeps those recursive checks off hot cache-hit paths. Its entries copy the projected primitives in
and hold them for as long as the entry lives, so an entry count alone would leave the retained
bytes unbounded. Admission therefore also has a projected-size ceiling
(`LIONAGI_STRUCTURAL_CACHE_VALUE_LIMIT`) measured on the ordering token, which already frames every
descendant's token and so accumulates without any branch having to remember to report its own size.
A token that stands for identity rather than content is the one case that ceiling cannot price, and
weak identity is what bounds that branch: the entry cannot outlive what the token stands for.
Exceeding the ceiling withholds caching only: the value stays structurally comparable and hashable,
because retention is never a correctness question. Field-layout, sentinel-policy, and
sentinel-singleton caches likewise wrap class objects in identity keys so permissive metaclass
equality cannot cross-wire their values.

One residual is deliberate and bounded. This cache is keyed on the declaration instance, and a
frozen dataclass declared with `slots=True` cannot be weakly referenced, so its entry has to hold
it and holds whatever it refers to along with it. Declining to store those instances instead costs
roughly an order of magnitude on the projection of every such declaration, measured on `Spec`, so
they are stored under a narrower rule: an instance is admitted only when each of its
identity-keyed components is already held alive elsewhere under its own name, which is checked by
resolving `__module__` and `__qualname__` back to the same object. Closures, lambdas, and `type()`
results fail that check and keep their holders out of the cache. A component reached through a
wrapper counts: every projection that rebuilds its key from a child value carries the child's
result forward, so an `Enum` member value, a mapping value, or a model field cannot hide one. What the rule does not cover is a
callable that satisfies it at admission and is unbound afterwards, since a name can be withdrawn
and a cache entry outlives the binding. Such a callable stays alive until its entry is evicted,
which is bounded by `LIONAGI_STRUCTURAL_CACHE_SIZE`. Instances that can be weakly referenced carry
no residual at all, and neither do the field-layout, sentinel-policy, and sentinel-singleton
caches, whose keys are the projections rather than the instances.

The annotation and model caches are keyed on projections too, and that alone does not bound them:
each entry holds a built annotation or model, and a built value refers to the declaration's own
callables. A weak key stays resolvable because the entry's own value keeps its referent alive, so
the entry outlives the name the callable was reachable under. Their shared admission gate therefore
reads the same pin flag the projection cache reads and declines to key anything that pins. A
declaration carrying a closure or a `type()` result is rebuilt on each use rather than cached,
which is the cost the narrower rule above already accepts elsewhere.

**The decoration contract is part of this decision.** The base implementations above are reachable
only when a subclass does not shadow them, and today's subclasses decide that by accident. A
`@dataclass(frozen=True)` subclass of `Params` generates its own `__eq__` and `__hash__` and those
win over the base ones. Two equality semantics are therefore live in the package at once, selected
by a decorator argument:

| Subclass decoration | `__eq__` in force | Observable behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `@dataclass(frozen=True)` (default `eq=True`) | dataclass-generated | field-tuple equality requiring the same class; `hash()` raises `TypeError` when any field value is unhashable, including values the base `__hash__` handles |
| `@dataclass(frozen=True, eq=False)` before D4 | inherited `Params.__eq__` | hash equality; two *different* `Params` subclasses holding equal fields can compare equal |

Neither column is what D4 specifies. The decision is therefore:

- `Params`, `Spec`, and `Meta` subclasses declare `eq=False` so the structural implementations are
  the ones in force, and the structural `__eq__` compares concrete type first, which closes the
  cross-subclass equality shown in the second row;
- the house-rule gate in D8 fails a subclass of these bases that is decorated with `eq=True` or
  that defines its own `__eq__` or `__hash__` without declaring an override reason;
- the audit that precedes the `HashableModel` split covers `Params` subclasses too, because a
  subclass that relies on the first row's same-class requirement changes behavior when the
  structural implementation takes over.

`HashableModel` is split by semantics during migration: immutable concrete models retain a
structural hash, while mutable models become unhashable. Existing uses are audited before the
base behavior changes because a mutable object already stored in a set cannot be repaired after
mutation.

### D5 — `Spec` and `Operable` are the only neutral declaration vocabulary

`Spec` continues to describe one logical field:

```python
Spec(
    base_type,
    name="run_id",
    nullable=False,
    default=...,
    validator=...,
    metadata=(...),
)
```

`Operable` continues to describe one ordered collection of fields. Neither imports Pydantic,
SQLAlchemy, StateDB, Studio, or a provider SDK merely to store the declaration.

Domain information is namespaced metadata interpreted by an adapter. Common metadata remains
limited to framework-neutral meaning. For example, the persistence adapter may interpret:

```text
storage.column_name
storage.physical_type.sqlite
storage.physical_type.postgresql
storage.primary_key_position
storage.foreign_key
storage.bind_codec
storage.result_codec
```

Those keys do not make `Spec` itself a SQL column. A policy adapter may interpret a different
namespace, and an external-hook adapter another. Unknown namespaced metadata is preserved by the
neutral layer and either rejected or ignored according to the chosen adapter's closed contract.

The materialization seam is:

```python
class SpecAdapter(Protocol[OutputT]):
    def materialize(self, declaration: Operable, /, **options: Any) -> OutputT: ...
```

Concrete adapters own validation needed by their target:

- Pydantic adapter rejects unnamed fields and emits `FieldInfo`/model types;
- persistence adapter combines an `Operable` with immutable `EntitySpec` table/index/codec
  parameters and emits SQLAlchemy objects;
- wire adapter emits a versioned JSON-compatible DTO/schema;
- policy adapter compiles a neutral policy declaration for a concrete harness/provider.

`FieldModel` and `OperableModel` remain compatibility materializations during migration. New
architecture does not extend them as a parallel declaration stack. Production users such as
ReAct migrate to the neutral declaration plus adapter before the compatibility models are
deprecated.

### D6 — Registries are explicit immutable snapshots

A declaration module exports values. It does not mutate the active registry when imported.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True, init=False, eq=False)
class Registry(Params, Generic[ItemT]):
    name: str
    items: tuple[ItemT, ...]
    version: str | UnsetType = Unset

    @classmethod
    def compose(cls, *fragments: RegistryFragment[ItemT]) -> Registry[ItemT]: ...
```

Composition occurs at a named application boundary:

```python
entity_registry = EntityRegistry.compose(core_state_entities, studio_entities)
hook_profiles = ExternalHookProfiles.compose(builtin_profiles, enabled_plugin_profiles)
tool_catalog = ToolCatalog.compose(builtin_tools, selected_mcp_tools)
```

Exact semantics:

- fragment and item order are explicit and stable;
- duplicate canonical keys fail with both owners named unless the registry type declares a
  versioned override rule;
- an override is recorded in the registry snapshot and its canonical hash;
- optional modules contribute a fragment only when the composition root enables them;
- querying an uncomposed optional fragment cannot import that feature implicitly; it raises the
  missing-feature error ADR-0122 D4 defines, so neither record assumes the other supplies it;
- a registry snapshot is immutable and safe to attach to a Run or schema plan;
- dynamic plugin enablement produces a new snapshot/version; it does not mutate a snapshot being
  used by an in-flight operation;
- module reload does not duplicate registrations because imports do not register.

This rejects decorator-driven global self-registration for schema, hooks, providers, and tools.
Decorators may tag declarations; the composition root must still collect an explicit declared
set.

The shape already exists in the package and is the reference implementation for this decision.
`lionagi/state/lifecycle/policy.py` builds `DEFAULT_REGISTRY` through an explicit
`build_default_registry()` that names each policy it composes rather than collecting whatever
imported itself. Migration of the remaining registries is an alignment with that module, not an
invention, and a reviewer comparing a proposed registry against it has a concrete standard to
compare to.

### D7 — durable snapshots are distinct from wire serialization and runtime hash

`to_dict()` remains an omission-oriented application/wire projection. Durable schema, policy,
registry, plan, and Run identities use a separate strict surface:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True, init=False, eq=False)
class SnapshotEnvelope(Params):
    domain: str
    contract_version: str
    payload: JsonValue

def to_snapshot(value: Any, *, domain: str, contract_version: str,
                require_resolved: bool = True) -> SnapshotEnvelope: ...
def canonical_bytes(snapshot: SnapshotEnvelope) -> bytes: ...
def canonical_digest(snapshot: SnapshotEnvelope) -> str: ...  # sha256-v1
```

`require_resolved=True` rejects every nested `Unset` with its field path. `Undefined` is omitted
only because the field is outside that projection; `None` remains explicit JSON null. The envelope
contains a namespaced domain and contract version so identical payloads in different authorities
do not share an accidental identity. `canonical_bytes` is UTF-8 canonical JSON through LionAGI's
internal serializer: mapping keys sorted by encoded key, semantic sequences preserved, no NaN or
non-finite numbers, and normalized versioned adapters for timestamps, paths, enums, bytes, and
identifiers. `canonical_digest` is lowercase SHA-256 over those exact bytes and records algorithm
`sha256-v1` beside every persisted reference.

Python `_structural_key()` and `__hash__` remain runtime equality/container mechanics. Their
integer result is never serialized, persisted, signed, compared across processes, or used as a
schema/policy/plan identity.

Raw callable objects are forbidden in durable declarations. Runtime-only `Spec` values may retain
callable identity semantics, but any validator/codec/compiler function that contributes to a
snapshot is an immutable `CallableRef(namespace, name, version, implementation_digest)` resolved
through an explicit registry. Missing, ambiguous, or digest-mismatched resolution fails before
materialization; importing a module path is not itself proof of the referenced implementation.

### D8 — Determinism and house rules are executable gates

The foundation suite adds the following required matrices.

**Defaults and absence**

- literal default, default factory, supplied value, `Unset`, `Undefined`, and explicit `None`;
- factory called once per instance;
- strict and compatibility serializer modes;
- nested path in unresolved-sentinel errors.

**Order and canonical serialization**

- include/exclude passed as list, tuple, set, and frozenset yields declaration order;
- composed Operables retain operand order;
- separate processes with at least four `PYTHONHASHSEED` values emit byte-identical canonical
  bytes and equal `sha256-v1` digests for schemas, policies, and registries;
- intentional reorder changes the canonical digest;
- unresolved nested `Unset`, a raw callable, and a mismatched `CallableRef` digest each fail strict
  snapshot construction before bytes are emitted.

**Equality/hash**

- equal dictionaries with different insertion order produce equal `Meta` values, while both
  remain explicitly unhashable because the live dictionaries are mutable;
- unequal values remain unequal even under an injected hash collision;
- immutable sequences and frozensets produce equal runtime hashes for equal projections within a
  process; mutable dict/list/set descendants make `Params`/`Meta`/`Spec` unhashable;
- mutable `DataClass` and mutable Pydantic models are unhashable after their consumer migration;
- callable metadata retains identity semantics;
- unsupported opaque mutable metadata fails explicitly;
- `True`, `1`, `1.0`, signed zero, sentinel states, enum types, and custom-metaclass type identities
  remain distinct where their typed runtime meaning differs;
- annotation/model caches reuse repeated stable declarations, bypass mutable/bound-method values,
  and never cross-wire adapter, `Spec`, or base-type subclasses;
- two different subclasses of one base holding equal field values are unequal, which is the
  cross-subclass equality the pre-migration `eq=False` decoration admits;
- a subclass of `Params`, `Spec`, or `Meta` decorated `eq=True`, or defining `__eq__` or
  `__hash__` outside the three base authorities, fails a closed static check rather than silently
  selecting generated implementations;
- `none_as_sentinel` and `empty_as_sentinel` are set only from call sites named in D1's
  enumerated list, and a diff that sets either elsewhere fails.

**Adapter separation**

- importing `lionagi.ln.types` does not import Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, StateDB, Studio, provider
  SDKs, or CLI modules;
- neutral declarations round-trip through internal serialization only;
- target-specific validation occurs only when the corresponding adapter is invoked;
- no new raw `asyncio`, `json`, schema-library, or serialization helper is introduced outside the
  approved `lionagi.ln` seams.

**Compatibility**

- existing public imports remain during their declared window;
- current Pydantic output is characterized before adapter replacement;
- persisted/wire payload fixtures are dual-read before old forms are removed;
- a migration that changes canonical bytes increments the owning contract version.

## Implementation sequence

1. Add failing characterization tests for current defaults, unnamed specs, selection order,
   equality/hash, mutable hashing, and import boundaries.
2. Introduce shared field/default discovery and structural-key helpers without changing public
   signatures.
3. Fix `Params` defaults and ordered serialization; add `field_names()` while retaining
   `allowed()` as membership compatibility.
4. Fix `Operable` selection and unnamed-spec handling; remove set conversion from model
   materialization.
5. Correct `Meta`/`Spec` equality and hash; inventory and split mutable `HashableModel` users.
6. Move production callers from `OperableModel` to neutral declarations and adapters.
7. Introduce explicit registry fragments at composition roots.
8. Land strict snapshot envelopes, canonical bytes/digest, and versioned CallableRef resolution.
9. Only then allow ADR-0118 schema hashes, harness policy snapshots, dispatch policies, and Run
   contracts to depend on these primitives.

No schema, permission, or Run migration may quietly bundle steps 1-5. The foundation changes
have a high fan-in and receive their own compatibility review.

## Consequences

- New architecture reuses LionAGI's own concepts rather than adding frozen dataclass and Pydantic
  forests beside them.
- Schema hashes, policy snapshots, and generated API contracts become reproducible across
  processes.
- Absence and inheritance stop changing meaning between AgentSpec, MCP scope, provider config,
  StateDB patches, and frontend payloads.
- Explicit registry composition makes optional loading and test isolation possible.
- Some existing accidental behavior changes: defaults begin working, unnamed specs stop
  colliding, and include selection becomes declaration-ordered. Those changes require targeted
  compatibility tests and release notes even though they are bug fixes.
- Mutable models lose convenient hashing. Code relying on that unsound behavior must use stable
  identity or an immutable snapshot key.
- Adapters become slightly more explicit at call sites. That cost buys a dependency boundary and
  prevents storage/provider details from entering `ln.types`.
- Reversal would be expensive after schema and policy hashes are persisted, so canonicalization
  is versioned from its first durable use.

## Alternatives considered

### Leave the primitives as convenience helpers and create new architecture-specific models

This minimizes immediate changes to high-fan-in code. It also creates parallel absence,
serialization, ordering, equality, and adapter rules in every ADR. That is the current failure
mode at a new layer and was rejected.

### Port the Krons type and schema files

Krons demonstrates useful metadata and adapter composition. Executed probes found the same
set-order and mutable-hash hazards, plus validation bypass caused by custom construction. A bulk
port would import defects and PostgreSQL assumptions while obscuring which LionAGI contract was
chosen. Patterns are referenced; files are not copied.

### Use Pydantic models for every declaration and runtime context

Pydantic gives strong public validation and JSON Schema emission. It also makes the lowest layer
framework-dependent, encourages mutable models to masquerade as immutable specs, and does not by
itself define deterministic registry composition or storage semantics. Pydantic remains a
materialization target.

### Use ordinary frozen dataclasses and `dataclasses.asdict`

This would honor defaults and order, but it collapses sentinel and codec behavior, recursively
copies values with no versioned wire policy, and provides no common adapter/registry contract.
The existing types are retained and corrected instead.

### Self-register declarations at import time

Self-registration is terse and works in a monolithic eager import. It makes schema and policy
contents depend on optional imports, plugin order, test history, and module reload. That is
incompatible with deterministic hashes and conditional loading, so explicit composition wins.

### Sort every collection before hashing

Sorting masks nondeterminism but destroys semantic order for fields, interceptor stages, index
keys, and graph edges. Only semantically unordered mappings and sets are canonical-sorted; ordered
declarations retain their order.

## Notes

The word “BaseModel” is intentionally absent from the foundational ownership table. LionAGI may
continue to export Pydantic's `BaseModel`, but it is a framework type, not the architectural base
for configuration, mutable execution state, identity, schema declarations, and persistence rows
all at once.
