# Public-Surface Breaking-Change and Deprecation Policy

**Purpose**: Define what counts as public surface in LionAGI, require an explicit deprecation
path before removing or renaming anything on that surface, and establish CHANGELOG discipline
for communicating changes to consumers.

---

## 0. Scope while this repository is own-use

Under the owner directive of 2026-07-11 declaring this repository own-use — built for our own
consumption, not constrained by external callers, with redirect/compatibility shims named as the
thing not to do — the alias-plus-warning-plus-release cycle in section 2 does not bind this
repository while that directive stands. It continues to bind packages this repository ships to
external callers. Two things do not change under this scope clause: every public removal still
requires a `Removed` CHANGELOG entry (the audit record was never in tension with own-use), and
reviewers reject a public removal that lacks one, regardless of whether the deprecation cycle
applied.

---

## 1. What Counts as Public Surface

The following are public surface. Removing, renaming, or incompatibly changing them requires
the deprecation path in section 2.

- **Top-level `lionagi` exports**: every name reachable via `from lionagi import <name>` or
  listed in `lionagi/__init__.py`'s `__all__`.
- **`lionagi.ln` and `lionagi.state` exports**: everything in their `__all__`.
- **Any package `__all__`**: a name in `__all__` is a public commitment, regardless of depth.
- **Documented hook names** (`HookPoint` enum values and string keys referenced in docs or
  `AgentSpec` / `HooksMixin` public APIs).
- **CLI flags and subcommands**: flags of `li`, `li agent`, `li o flow`, `li o fanout`,
  `li schedule`, and `li studio` that appear in `--help` output.
- **Provider and endpoint names**: string identifiers accepted by `iModel` / `match_endpoint`
  that are documented or emitted in error messages.

Names prefixed with `_`, not listed in `__all__`, and not referenced in official docs are
internal. Internal names may change without notice.

---

## 2. The Deprecation Path

Before removing or renaming a public name, follow all four steps.

**Step 1: Keep a backward-compatible alias and emit a warning.**

```python
import warnings

# Old name stays; new name is the canonical one.
def new_name(*args, **kwargs): ...

def old_name(*args, **kwargs):
    warnings.warn(
        "old_name is deprecated and will be removed in a future minor release. "
        "Use new_name instead.",
        DeprecationWarning,
        stacklevel=2,
    )
    return new_name(*args, **kwargs)
```

**Step 2: Add a CHANGELOG "Deprecated" entry** under `[Unreleased]` (see section 4).

**Step 3: Wait at least one minor release.** The alias and warning must ship together in a
released version before the old name can be removed.

**Step 4: Remove the alias in a later minor or major release.** Add a "Removed" entry to
CHANGELOG. Do not remove silently.

There are no exceptions to silent removal. If a public name must disappear immediately due to
a security defect or a name that was never functional (see section 3), document why in the
commit message and CHANGELOG.

**Options that are accepted and silently ignored.** A flag whose value is never read still
parses, so an invocation passing it succeeds today and fails to parse once it is gone. Under
section 1 a flag visible in `--help` is public surface, and being inert does not change that:
what a caller depends on here is the command running at all, not the flag doing anything. All
four steps apply.

What inertness does change is which signal reaches the caller. A deprecated function warns when
called; an inert flag has no code path to warn from, and its own uselessness is invisible from
the outside, so nothing in a caller's logs ever suggested it was dead. Step 1 for this case is
therefore to keep accepting the option and emit the deprecation warning at parse time, and the
step 4 `Removed` entry is the only other notice they will get. Removing an inert option needs
more disclosure than a normal deprecation, not less.

Inertness is also a claim about one surface and has to be verified rather than assumed, because
the same option can be live on one surface and inert on another. Verify it by running the
parser on each surface you are claiming it is inert on, not by searching a directory: options
are commonly declared in a shared argument provider that no per-surface path contains, so a
path-scoped search reports a flag as absent while `--help` still prints it.

---

## 3. Allowed Without Deprecation

These changes may be made without the alias-plus-warning cycle.

- **Purely additive exports**: adding a new name to `__all__` or a new CLI flag. Existing
  consumers are unaffected.
- **Fixing a name that never worked**: if importing or calling the name has always raised an
  exception (e.g., missing dependency, broken wiring), it was never a functional public
  contract. Document this in the commit message.
- **Internal-only changes**: refactoring or renaming anything not in `__all__` and not
  documented. Confirm the name does not appear in any example, cookbook, or docs page first.
- **Type annotation narrowing that is source-compatible**: adding `| None` or a more specific
  return type does not break callers.

---

## 4. CHANGELOG Discipline

Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` using Keep-a-Changelog conventions. Each release version has up to
five sections. Only include sections that have entries.

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Short description of new capability.

### Changed
- Short description of a non-breaking behavioral change.

### Deprecated
- `old_name` in `lionagi.ln` — use `new_name` instead. Will be removed in a future release.

### Removed
- `old_name`, deprecated since v0.X. Use `new_name`.

### Fixed
- Short description of a bug fix.
```

Every PR that touches public surface must update `[Unreleased]`. Code reviewers reject a patch
that removes or renames a public name and has no `Removed` (or `Deprecated`, where section 2
still applies) CHANGELOG entry for it; a removal with the required entry present does not trigger
this instruction, deprecation-cycle scope under section 0 notwithstanding.

---

## 5. Mechanism

Use Python's stdlib `warnings` module with `DeprecationWarning`. No new framework is needed.
Set `stacklevel=2` so the warning points to the caller's line, not the alias itself.

`DeprecationWarning` is ignored by default in non-`__main__` contexts. Consumers who want
to see them run with `-W default::DeprecationWarning` or use `pytest`'s `-W` flag. This is
intentional: it surfaces warnings in test suites without spamming production logs.

Do not use `FutureWarning` (reserved for user-facing warnings from end-user scripts) or
`PendingDeprecationWarning` (too quiet). `DeprecationWarning` is the correct choice.
